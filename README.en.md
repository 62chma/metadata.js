### Concept
In metadata.js, we attempt to supplemented the best of modern technologies of data processing, tools that we did not have in their daily work
- We use the most valuable from 1C
- Complements ES6 and Web UI

### Unlike competitors
Metadata.js not compete with client Web UI and client-server (including reactive) frameworks, and complements the new abstraction of [data objects](http://www.oknosoft.ru/upzp/apidocs/classes/DataObj.html) and [data managers](http://www.oknosoft.ru/upzp/apidocs/classes/DataManager.html). Using these classes simplifies the development of complex interfaces of business applications.
